# Test-driven development Kata

This Kata is based on a lecture designed by Alexandre Bergel (University of Chile).

## Specifications

It builds a two-dimensional graphics framework, using a test-driven approach. The framework
has the following features

* As a user, I want to model widgets such as Circles and Rectangles so that they can be displayed on the console
* As a user, I want to apply operations such as translation to widgets so that I can work with the widgets.


## Overview of the kata

1.  Creating a canvas to contain widgets
2.  Introducing some widgets
3.  Cleaning the code
4.  Applying operations to widgets
5.  Canvas support for operations
6.  Grouping widgets
7.  Canvas refactoring
8.  Introducing widget scaling
9.  Cleaning and Refactoring
10. Recursive groups

## Step #1: Creating a canvas to contain widgets

The intention is to define a ``Canvas`` that will contains graphical objects.

1. Create a Java Test, e.g., ``HotDrawTest``
2. Specify the behavior of such a ``Canvas``:
    * A ``canvas`` can be instantiated as an object
    * A ``canvas`` is empty by default
3.

    git checkout step1
